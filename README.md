## What is Silver Decipherer?

Silver Decipherer is a proposed iOS and Android application designed to **translate and normalize global silver prices into a form that everyday buyers can understand**, with a specific focus on:

- Shanghai silver prices (SGE / SHFE)
- United States silver prices (COMEX / US benchmarks)
- USD-per-troy-ounce normalization
- Transparent display of **price spreads and premiums**

The goal is to remove opacity and confusion for retail silver buyers by showing, in plain English, how different markets price silver and how large the divergence can be on any given day.

## Why This Exists

Retail buyers often see a single “spot price” without understanding:
- Which market it comes from
- How other major markets are pricing silver
- Whether they are paying into a premium or discount environment

Daily spreads of several dollars per ounce between Shanghai and US markets are real, persistent, and poorly communicated to the public. Silver Decipherer exists to make this visible.

## Open Source Philosophy

This repository contains the **original concept, specification, and architecture** for Silver Decipherer.  
Developers are encouraged to build implementations in an open-source manner while **preserving attribution** to the original author.
